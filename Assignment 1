1. The assembler and linker work together by the assembler converting the source code from assembly langauage into machine language, while
the Linker combines the individuals files that are created by the assembler into a single executable program
3. A high level language has a one-to-many releation compared to machine language becuase one statement in the high level language requires 
multiple statements in the machine language
8. I soppose that type checking on pointer variables in c and c++ is more stricter than assembly language can access memory addreses that
high level languages get restricted on
